<h1 align="center">Welcome to The Widgets App 👋</h1>
<p>
</p>

> This app built with ReactJS is a combination of four small widgets, built for the solely purpose of practicing different React functionality, including hooks such as useState and useEffect, react-router-dom, and front-end libraries such as Semantic-UI. The app has a navigation bar to navigate through each widget:

- Accordion
  This widget could be use as an example of a Q&A section of a larger website. It is a small display of questions that the user can click to expand the answer for each question.

- Search
  This is a search bar to find information using the Wikipedia API. Upon finishing typing the user will be given 10 results, with a title and small description. The user then has the chance to click on a particular search result and will be redirected to the correct article in Wikipedia.

- Dropdown
  This dropdown uses the selected option to change the color of a text using. It could be scale for different uses such as changing a website color, or display different feature depending on user selection.

- Translate
  This widget uses the Google Translate API, and it is a small mock up of Google Translate service.
